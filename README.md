# SerenityOS Man Pages Website

This repo contains the source for the SerenityOS man pages website, [man.serenityos.org](https://man.serenityos.org/).
This is automatically generated from the sources [here](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/tree/master/Base/usr/share/man), in the main SerenityOS repo.
Please do not submit PRs here to modify the man pages.
Instead, submit them to [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) so that they can be viewed both on the website and inside the OS.
Thank you!
